<h1 align="left"> Santec Python FTDI </h1>
Pure python backend script to control Santec instruments via USB. 

<br> 

<h2>Usage</h2>

1) Import the ftd2xxhelper file in your main program,
    ```python
   import ftd2xxhelper
   ```
2) List of detected devices,
    ```python
    list_of_devices = FTD2XXHelper.ListDevices()
    print(list_of_devices)
   ```
    
2) Printing each device's properties,
    ```python
    for device in list_of_devices:
      print(device.Description)
      print(device.SerialNumber)
   ```          
   
3) Creating an device control instance,
    ```python
   # Here parameter is the Serial number of the instrument in string format
   device = FTD2XXHelper("SerialNumber")        # Instrument Serial Number Example = 23110980, 20208978, 21862492
    ```    

4) To get the device identification string,
    ```python
    idn_query = device.QueryIdn()                 # Output: SANTEC INS-(ModelNumber), SerialNumber, VersionNumber
    print(idn_query)
    ```

5) To write a command,
    ```python
    device.Write('command')                       # refer to the instrument datasheet for commands
    ```

6) To query a command,
    ```python
    result = device.Query('command')              # refer to the instrument datasheet for commands
    print(result)
    ```
    ‚ùó If the above method does not work, then instead use the Write() followed by Read() method as shown below,
    ```python
    device.Write('command')                       # refer to the instrument datasheet for commands
    result = device.Read()            
    print(result)
    ```   
  
7) Closing the device usb connection after use. Any future commands sent will throw an exception, as the connection is already closed,
    ```python
    device.CloseUsbConnection()
    ```
